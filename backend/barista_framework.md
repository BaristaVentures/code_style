### Barista Framework

There is a set of components that are spread and/or duplicated across several projects, but can be tied up as a `clojars` package in order to be reused seamless on all API's.

- CORS ruler
- Schema errors humanizer
- Authorization middleware
- API integrations (S3, Sendgrid, OneSignal)
- Error formatter
- Current set of utils helpers (validators, dates, parsers, paginator, etc)
- Luminus template with the Registration/Authentication workflow
