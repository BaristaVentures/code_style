# Project Keys

The idea is centralize the keys that services like GMaps use with one account per project, like:

1. Create an account per project `<project>-account@gmail.com`.
1. Add add acccount to [Meldium](https://www.meldium.com/) and david@barista-v.com as recovery option.
1. Create _staging_ and _production_ keys per client (android, iOS, ember, etc...) in `<project>-account@gmail.com` account.

The idea of having _staging_ and _production_ projects per client is to have different quotas.
