# Barista Project Workflow 
In the follwing pages, you will find all the information necessary to navigate and effectively start working on any of the Barista projects. 
Every single one of them  must go through the following stages: First, the project is defined and scope, followed by the planning, execution  and finally, the review. For each stage, there are some specific tools and protocols that must be followed.

This process is both the big picture of every project and the small day to day life here at Barista: the planning, execution and review cycle is done alsmot weekly.

## Project Definition and Scope <a name="scope"></a> 
Every project must start with a basic introduction to the team and a kick off meeting with the client for the official presentations. Once this is done, the documentation must be started with the follwing information in a dedicated folder in Google Drive:

### Basic Information <a name="basic"></a>
    * Start and estimated end dates.
    * General description.
    * Initial documentation/mockups/wireframes... submited by the client.
    * Asigned team.
    * Day and hour for the weekly planning. 
    
In addition, every project must have it's repository and a dedicated Slack channel.

Currently there are two plataforms in use: GitHub and GitLab, the selection of one over the other depends on the needs of the project in terms of communication wit the client.
