## Project Definition and Scope <a name="scope"></a> 
Every project must start with a basic introduction to the team and a kick off meeting with the client for the official presentations. Once this is done, the documentation must be started with the follwing information in a dedicated folder in Google Drive:

### Basic Information <a name="basic"></a>
    * Start and estimated end dates.
    * General description.
    * Initial documentation/mockups/wireframes... submited by the client.
    * Asigned team.
    * Day and hour for the weekly planning. 
    
In addition, every project must have it's repository [^footnote] and a dedicated Slack channel.

[^footnote]: Curently there are two plataforms in use: GitHub and GitLab, the selection of one over the other depends on the needs of the project in terms of communication wit the client.
