# Bug report template - Front-End

## The goal

Barista Ventures is a fast growing company with lots of clients and different projects and technologies, this mix of projects + deadlines sometimes leads to situations where is hard to understand what is under the hood when things are not working as expected.
Bug reporting demonstrates a development issue and gives developers a place to start fixing it. It may be tempting to write a 10-page report on what you discover or go to the other corner and just create a card with a title that does not give real information about the situation. This is why to have a bug report template can make things easier. The simpler and more clear the report is, the better will be in the long run for everyone involved in the dev process.

## The template

We can use a bug tracker app, our current management app or even plain text, it really does not matter
which tool we use as long as the bug report contains:


* [Feature Name] Title
* Environment
* Url/Endpoint
* Expected result
* Actual result
* Visual proof (Screenshots, videos, text)
* Steps to reproduce (If needed)


### Example

OMFG! Login is not working and the client is really mad, I should report this bug ASAP to our dev team.

***
**[LOGIN] Not able to login as admin in the app**

**Environment:**
Env: Production
Browser: Chrome
`Add as many information you think is needed here, App Version, API version, OS, Device, etc.`

**URL/Endpoint:**
http://www.domain.com/login

**Expected result:**
Admin should be able to login successfully

**Actual result:**
Admin is getting stuck with no error message displayed

**Visual proof**

**Steps to reproduce**
1. From root page, tap on login button
2. Enter all credentials and clic on login

## Final thoughts

This can be hard to follow at the beginning but for sure will give the necessary information to a developer to understand the bug and then decide what are the options to fix it.
